===============

Your program should have the following output

http://localhost:5000 - should display 8 by 8 checkerboard
http://localhost:5000/4 - should display 8 by 4 checkerboard
http://localhost:5000/(x)/(y) - should display x by y checkerboard.  For example, http://localhost:5000/10/10 should display 10 by 10 checkerboard.
Before you pass x or y to Jinja, please remember to convert it to integer first (so that you can use x or y in a for loop)
